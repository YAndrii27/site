Hi. I'm Andrii (also referred to as Andrew and Andy). I'm passionate developer who loves learning new things. My main areas are Web and Mobile Development. Programming languages I use are:
  
- Java  
- JavaScript / TypeScript (including React.js, Angular.js, Node.js) 
- Python (including Django framework, Flask, FastAPI) 
  
I learned all the languages above by myself. Now, I'm also learning more about those in my Bachelor degree course.
